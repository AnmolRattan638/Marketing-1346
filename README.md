# Marketing-1346: autonomous marketing for AR Designs

Daily pipeline: **strategist -> research (Gemma) -> analysis (GPT-OSS 120B) -> writer (Gemini) -> fact-check -> ad-check -> image + reel idea -> Telegram approval -> Buffer (Instagram, LinkedIn, Bluesky)**.
Nothing is posted until you tap **Approve** in Telegram.

## Setup
Repo -> Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions -> add **secrets**:

| Secret | Where from |
|---|---|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Google AI Studio (Gemini + Gemma) |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | console.groq.com (GPT-OSS 120B) |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | your bot / your chat |
| `BUFFER_API_KEY` | publish.buffer.com/settings/api |

Optional **variables**: `GEMMA_MODEL`, `GROQ_MODEL`, `GEMINI_MODEL` (to change model IDs).

Telegram: approvals are polled with `getUpdates`, so the bot must have **no webhook** set (`/deleteWebhook`).

## Run
Actions -> **Daily draft** -> Run workflow (or wait for 08:00 IST). Tap Approve in Telegram; **Approve and publish** (every 15 min) posts it.

## Files
- `config/voice.md`, `config/services.json`: your voice and the facts the agents may use. **Edit these first.**
- `data/history.json`, `data/strategy.md`, `data/metrics.json`: state the agents learn from.
- `src/agents/*`: one file per agent; prompts live there.

## Known limits
- Google Flow has no API: the reel idea is sent to Telegram for you to generate manually.
- Images come from a free generator and are served to Buffer via this repo's raw URLs, so the repo must stay public.
- `data/metrics.json` is filled manually for now; automatic engagement collection is not built.
